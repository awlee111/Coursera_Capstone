Introduction
Background:
Whataburger makes the best fastfood burger in the US. However, the chain is only available in 10 states. Based out of Texas, expanding to TN is a GREAT idea.
Let's find a location to open a restaurant in Memphis, TN
Stakeholders: 
Restaurant investors looking for good location 
Me! A frequent customer that's tired of driving hours for a burger

Data used:
With the franchise being open 24/7, it is very popular with college/university students. 
We will target areas around the universities in town, University of Memphis, Rhodes College, Christian Brothers University, and LeMoyne Owen College.
Using Foursquare API, define locations of universites and explore these areas for fast food restaurant density
